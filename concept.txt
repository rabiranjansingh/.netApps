float a=5.5f; /// i have to provide the f at the ned otherwise it is treat as double 
A 32-bit floating point number

Floating Point Types :
There are 2 floating point data types which contain the decimal point.

Float: 
It is 32-bit single-precision floating point type. 
It has 7 digit Precision. To initialize a float variable, use the suffix f or F. 
Like, float x = 3.5F;. If the suffix F or f will not use then it is treated as double.

Double:
It is 64-bit double-precision floating point type. It has 14 â€“ 15 digit Precision.
To initialize a double variable, use the suffix d or D. But it is not mandatory to use
suffix because by default floating data types are the double type.
