float a=5.5f; /// i have to provide the f at the ned otherwise it is treat as double 
A 32-bit floating point number

Floating Point Types :
There are 2 floating point data types which contain the decimal point.

Float: 
It is 32-bit single-precision floating point type. 
It has 7 digit Precision. To initialize a float variable, use the suffix f or F. 
Like, float x = 3.5F;. If the suffix F or f will not use then it is treated as double.

Double:
It is 64-bit double-precision floating point type. It has 14 â€“ 15 digit Precision.
To initialize a double variable, use the suffix d or D. But it is not mandatory to use
suffix because by default floating data types are the double type.


WHEN USE DECIMAL OR DOUBLE

Use decimal whenever you're dealing with quantities that you want to (and can) be represented exactly in base-10.
That includes monetary values, because you want 2.1234 to be represented exactly as 2.1234.

Use double when you don't need an exact representation in base-10. This is usually good for handling measurements, 
because those are already approximations, not exact quantities.

Of course, if having or not an exact representation in base-10 is not important to you, 
other factors come into consideration, which may or may not matter depending on the specific situation:

double has a larger range (it can handle very large and very small magnitudes);
decimal has more precision (has more significant digits);
you may need to use double to interact with some older APIs that are not aware of decimal;
double is faster than decimal;
decimal has a larger memory footprint;

for stock price use double
